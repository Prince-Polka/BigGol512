In 2014 I visited a friend of a friend, he used a playstation gamepad with a custom preset for X-padder, as a virtual keyboard+mouse for his pc. 

It was a bit clunky but I thought it was so cool I wanted to try it myself. 
Did some research and found keyboard periherals that you plug in to your controller.  
But for programs using the regular joysticks and buttons their interface all seemed clunky.  

I came up with an imo better idea,  
It was having a T9-like dictionary, snapping your joystick in 8 directions for each letter up until the last letter where you hold it at the edge and twist it like a rotary phone to select the word you wanted from the dictionary.  
Also visioned a spiral pattern, where you fan out when rotating many turns, but for simplicity I went with 3x3 boxes.

Made a prototype circling for every letter without a dictionary.   
Found the prototype I had backed up and recorded it.

This was made in fusion so the code is not reusable but I think I can remake something like it in processing wit quark's gamepad library.   
Just started trying to code a dictionary, using the mouse but the plan is to use the gamepad.

Here is the code in progress  
https://github.com/Prince-Polka/Processing-Sketches/tree/master/TYPING  

Doing it in processing will not let you use it as a virtual keyboard as I don't think there's any library for that.  
And even if you could, if you really wanted to type on a gamepad you could get a keypad-perhiperhal.  
But still?  
Is this a worthwhile project?
